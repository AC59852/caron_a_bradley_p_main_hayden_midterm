		<h2>Why Mac is Better</h2>
		<img src="images/mac_transparent.png" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>When it comes to computers, the question of what's better between Mac and PC becomes almost an arguement. In a debate, here are some reasons that Mac may be considered a better option between the two.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="images/mac_interface.jpg" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>Reason one would be Mac's Operating System. The OS used within apple computers is much easier to navigate through. With system preferences having easy access, users are able to make the system how they'd like for their own personal usage without much difficulty. The interface also integrates with iOS, which helps users who may be using mobile apple products to keep their devices in sync. As well as that, the Operating System itself faces less attacks from viruses. There is not as much vulnerability within the security bases.</p>

		Another reason Mac may be better than PC is the number of available programs preinstalled to the device. There are tools to use for pretty much anything, from notes all the way to iMovie or Garageband. There's also integrated software to assist with programming. Terminal is used for programming within Mac systems, and is very easy to update. It's also very hard to remove preinstalled software from the computers without utilizing terminal to prevent deletation of programs that are needed to run the system. The only disadvantage is that someone may not be able to uninstall programs they don't use without being intimidated by using terminal. But, at least it's not like it is in Windows, where someone could accidentally delete their system by mistake.

		Other reasons one may choose Mac over PC would be the way the devices look. Macs have a very sleek, modern appeal, and are made with strong hardware. They can be a lot lighter to travel with compared to a PC laptop, with almost the same level of protection from drops, spills, etc. Some Mac devices may have the exact same hardware in certain areas as a PC laptop would, however, the Mac OS optimizes the usage of the components to ensure they are performing at the highest level of efficiency. Macs have a better display than Windows computers as well, having no air gaps, anti-reflectant screens integrated, and consistent high DPI display.

		Over all, Mac has a more user friendly interface, better preinstalled software, and a next to equal level of hardware effeciency in comparison to PC. At the end of the debate, it's all about user preference anyways.
