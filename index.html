		<h1>Mac and PC Are Both Equally Reliable Computers</h1>
	<p>Mac and PC, although known for having their disagreements, have very few differences between their interfaces and commands.
	<br>
	Most keybinds or controls are the exact same with small changes such as the "Ctrl" (PC) or the "Cmd" (MAC) keys.</p>
