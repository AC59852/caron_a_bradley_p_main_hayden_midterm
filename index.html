		Why PC is Better Than Mac
	</h1> <!--Austins content-->

		The arguement for PC vs Mac has been a long and tedious debate between both sides. I tend to think that there is no debate, and that PC is the superior choice. When you think of technology, the first thought isn't, "How pretty should my computer be? What looks the most appealing." The first thought should be how practical, useful and efficient should the tools you require be for you. If you're a gamer, your first thought is how powerful of a computer do you need, will you need to future proof your setup, what OS will best work for the games you want to play. "A man is only as good as his tools," and if your tools are slow, unresponsive, or limited in preference, you'll never build anything.

		<h2>Reliability</h2>

			When you see this ball, what do you think? What can you do? You look up Mac error codes, and get really upset because if it's a hardware problem, it costs just as much as the Mac itself. If it's a software problem, you take it in to the Apple store, and don't see your Mac for the next two weeks. PC, error codes show up with what's called a Blue Screen. You get the error code, and a description for what the error was. You can quickly look up the error, and fix the problem often times at home. If it's a hardware problem, you can identify the piece easily as all pieces have visually distinct looks. Changing a piece can be as cheap as $30 for a decent quality piece. PC's are built to be changed, and upgraded as electronics improve. Macs, you're stuck with what you buy, not being able to find a simple and wallet friendly way of keeping up with modern software and tech improvements.

		<h2>Power</h2>
		<p>
			Speaking of modern tech, Macs are clunky and slow when it comes to modern graphics or extreme editing software such as 3DS Max, After Effects, or even large Photoshop files. Mac has no dedicated Graphics Card, meaning that Macs rely on their processor to do all of the work for what you do. A graphics card is the muscle of a computer, loading and generating all objects on screen. A processor is the brain, remembering and "fetching" inputs, decoding objects for other parts to use, and pushing them out. Without the muscle, the brain now does everything, making their primary job much more tough now that they now have everything else to do. PC's have the ability to function without a graphics card, but have the option to add more than one, taking massisve load off the processor, and allowing you to preform any action with ease. This makes tasks like intense gaming, or major creative development a breaze for pc, and something non-existent on Mac.

		<h2>User Preference</h2>

		<p>
			Macs have this cool function where at the bottom of the screen, you have a limited amount of favourites you can select to open, with a couple being recent. Windows has had this functions since its inception, and the tabs are unlimited, minus the recently used apps. Windows has options to change where the bar is located, the size of the icons within the bar without changing the size of the bar, and so many more desktop options. Mac has the ability to change the size of the bar to something smaller, that's about it. Windows has the Windows button, opening up a detailed list of your favourite programs, recent programs, all files on your computer, and ease of access tools to the control panel to simplistically change any setting you want. Mac has the command button, which also opens a settings list, but much more tough to change ease of access settings like magnify, text to speech, text colour, uninstalling programs, and countless more. Mac does have the added ability of multiple functions with the command key, but this could complicate things by not having a dedicated key for commands like copy and paste. Within seconds of opening the Windows menu, I can change the size of my screen, mouse speed, and icon size on my Windows bar, this would take multiple tabs and searches on a Mac, taking away my ability to simply change my layout to something that best suits me.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				To end it off, Mac has some things that Windows doesn't. More access to simple to use software such as Garage Band, a sleek design that has low space taken up, and a pretty logo. But all of these things don't help me navigate programs with ease, or give incremental power boosts to run modern tech, or easily tell me when something is wrong. I cannot justify purchasing a Mac, when I can do everything and more with ease on a PC.
