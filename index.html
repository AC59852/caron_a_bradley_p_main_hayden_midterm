		The argument for PC vs Mac has been a long and tedious debate between both sides. I tend to think that there is no debate, and that PC is the superior choice. When you think of technology, the first thought isn't, "How pretty should my computer be? What looks the most appealing." The first thought should be how practical, useful and efficient should the tools you require be for you. If you're a gamer, your first thought is how powerful of a computer do you need, will you need to future proof your setup, what OS will best work for the games you want to play. "A man is only as good as his tools," and if your tools are slow, unresponsive, or limited in preference, you'll never build anything.

		<h2>Reliability</h2>

			When you see this ball, what do you think? What can you do? You look up Mac error codes, and get really upset because if it's a hardware problem, it costs just as much as the Mac itself. If it's a software problem, you take it in to the Apple store, and don't see your Mac for the next two weeks. PC, error codes show up with what's called a Blue Screen. You get the error code, and a description for what the error was. You can quickly look up the error, and fix the problem often times at home. If it's a hardware problem, you can identify the piece easily as all pieces have visually distinct looks. Changing a piece can be as cheap as $30 for a decent quality piece. PC's are built to be changed, and upgraded as electronics improve. Macs, you're stuck with what you buy, not being able to find a simple and wallet friendly way of keeping up with modern software and tech improvements.

		<h2>Power</h2>
		<p>
			Speaking of modern tech, Macs are clunky and slow when it comes to modern graphics or extreme editing software such as 3DS Max, After Effects, or even large Photoshop files. Mac has no dedicated Graphics Card, meaning that Macs rely on their processor to do all of the work for what you do. A graphics card is the muscle of a computer, loading and generating all objects on screen. A processor is the brain, remembering and "fetching" inputs, decoding objects for other parts to use, and pushing them out. Without the muscle, the brain now does everything, making their primary job much more tough now that they now have everything else to do. PC's have the ability to function without a graphics card, but have the option to add more than one, taking massisve load off the processor, and allowing you to preform any action with ease. This makes tasks like intense gaming, or major creative development a breaze for pc, and something non-existent on Mac.

		<h2>User Preference</h2>
		<img src="images/checklist.jpg" alt="Preference Checklist" height="150">
		<p>
			Macs have this cool function where at the bottom of the screen, you have a limited amount of favourites you can select to open, with a couple being recent. Windows has had this functions since its inception, and the tabs are unlimited, minus the recently used apps. Windows has options to change where the bar is located, the size of the icons within the bar without changing the size of the bar, and so many more desktop options. Mac has the ability to change the size of the bar to something smaller, that's about it. Windows has the Windows button, opening up a detailed list of your favourite programs, recent programs, all files on your computer, and ease of access tools to the control panel to simplistically change any setting you want. Mac has the command button, which also opens a settings list, but much more tough to change ease of access settings like magnify, text to speech, text colour, uninstalling programs, and countless more. Mac does have the added ability of multiple functions with the command key, but this could complicate things by not having a dedicated key for commands like copy and paste. Within seconds of opening the Windows menu, I can change the size of my screen, mouse speed, and icon size on my Windows bar, this would take multiple tabs and searches on a Mac, taking away my ability to simply change my layout to something that best suits me.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				To end it off, Mac has some things that Windows doesn't. More access to simple to use software such as Garage Band, a sleek design that has low space taken up, and a pretty logo. But all of these things don't help me navigate programs with ease, or give incremental power boosts to run modern tech, or easily tell me when something is wrong. I cannot justify purchasing a Mac, when I can do everything and more with ease on a PC.

		<h2>Why Mac is Better</h2>
		<img src="images/mac_transparent.png" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>When it comes to computers, the question of what's better between Mac and PC becomes almost an arguement. In a debate, here are some reasons that Mac may be considered a better option between the two.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="images/mac_interface.jpg" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>Reason one would be Mac's Operating System. The OS used within apple computers is much easier to navigate through. With system preferences having easy access, users are able to make the system how they'd like for their own personal usage without much difficulty. The interface also integrates with iOS, which helps users who may be using mobile apple products to keep their devices in sync. As well as that, the Operating System itself faces less attacks from viruses. There is not as much vulnerability within the security bases.</p>
		<br>
		<img src="images/mac_software.png" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>
		Another reason Mac may be better than PC is the number of available programs preinstalled to the device. There are tools to use for pretty much anything, from notes all the way to iMovie or Garageband. There's also integrated software to assist with programming. Terminal is used for programming within Mac systems, and is very easy to update. It's also very hard to remove preinstalled software from the computers without utilizing terminal to prevent deletation of programs that are needed to run the system. The only disadvantage is that someone may not be able to uninstall programs they don't use without being intimidated by using terminal. But, at least it's not like it is in Windows, where someone could accidentally delete their system by mistake.
		</p>
		<img src="images/system_32.png" width="25%" height="25%">
		<br>
		<p>
		Other reasons one may choose Mac over PC would be the way the devices look. Macs have a very sleek, modern appeal, and are made with strong hardware. They can be a lot lighter to travel with compared to a PC laptop, with almost the same level of protection from drops, spills, etc. Some Mac devices may have the exact same hardware in certain areas as a PC laptop would, however, the Mac OS optimizes the usage of the components to ensure they are performing at the highest level of efficiency. Macs have a better display than Windows computers as well, having no air gaps, anti-reflectant screens integrated, and consistent high DPI display. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<img src="images/mac_happy.png" width="25%" height="25%">
		<p>
		Over all, Mac has a more user friendly interface, better preinstalled software, and a next to equal level of hardware effeciency in comparison to PC. At the end of the debate, it's all about user preference anyways.

		<h1>Mac and PC Are Both Equally Reliable Computers</h1>
	<p>Mac and PC, although known for having their disagreements, have very few differences between their interfaces and commands.
	<br>
	Most keybinds or controls are the exact same with small changes such as the "Ctrl" (PC) or the "Cmd" (MAC) keys.</p>

		</ul>
		<img src="images/gaming_pc.jpg" width="300" height="200"></img>
		<br>
<h1>Con's of using a MAC or PC</h1>
	<p>Again, MAC and PC are both world renowned, but contain some flaws which steer customers towards their opposing company. Some of MAC's con's include</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mac does not have as much software created for them as they are not used for certain things as much as PC's</li>

			<li>Mac's are usually not backwards compatible and only work with some of the newest products</li>
			<li>MAC's are very expensive and customers sometimes feel that the hardware inside is not worth the price the computers are listed for</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>And some considerable Pro's of using PC are:</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>PC's have many loopholes and are prone to viruses and hackers</li>
			<li>PC's hidden and important software files are easily accessible creating the risk of a user deleting something important</li>
